<h3>Why AltSchool?</h3>
<p>I have always wanted to join AltSchool since 2022. Back then, I had just finished my university and was eager to try my hands at software engineering. However, I did not have the funds to sponsor this dream so I had to wait till I started working which was this year
    <br>This brings us to the present where I am finally learning what has always intrigued me. CODING!
